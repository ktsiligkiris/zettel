This paper deals with the problems of AoI in networks that consist of
a great number of nodes, which can lead to congestion and undesirable
levels of packet collisions.

Conclusions:
- Introduction of system age metric.
- Minimization of age cannot be achieved by maximization of throughput.
- A simple adaptation of CW that chooses to either increase or
  decrease CW size to reduce the system age is unsuitable.
- The above observations and the presence of a unique broadcast period
  at which system age is minimized motivated the design of an
  application layer rate control algorithm.
