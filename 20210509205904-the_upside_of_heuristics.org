#+title: The Upside of Heuristics

The economist Harry Markowitz won the 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics
for developing modern portfolio theory: his groundbreaking
"mean-variance portfolio optimization" showed how an investor could
make an optimal allocation among various funds and assets to maximize
returns at a given level of risk. So when it came time to invest his
own retirement savings, it seems like Markowitz should have been the
one person perfectly equipped for the job. What did he decide to do?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I should have computed the historical covariances of the asset classes
and drawn an efficient frontier. Instead, I visualized my grief if the
stock market went way up and I wasn't in it - or if it went way down
and I was completely in it. My intention was to minimize my future
regret. So I split my contribution fifty-fifty between bonds and equities.
