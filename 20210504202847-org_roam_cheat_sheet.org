#+title: org roam cheat sheet

* Create a new entry
  - M-x org-roam-find-file
  - Select a note to open or give a title to create a new one
  - Use C-c C-c to finish note capture

  You can also use M-x org-roam-capture

* Insert a link
  You can use M-x org-roam-insert to insert a link. A list of
  available notes is given and if you give a title of a none existent
  note, then a new note is created and the link to the note is added.

  Here is a link to a note: [[file:2020-08-17-2033 Losing best people.org][Losing best people]]

  I think initially that in my mac, I am using paragraph marks to
  signify links to other org-roam files (unless this is zetteldeft and
  I don't remember, who knows). I will replace all links to existing
  org-roam files.

* See backlinks
  You can bring up a buffer with backlinks to previous articles with
  M-x org-roam!!!
