#+title: The XY problem

The XY Problem (or X-Y Problem) often comes up in software development
or customer support, where someone asks for help to achieve a solution
(X) that they have chosen as a way to solve a different problem
(Y). Helping with their solution may not help them solve their actual
problem if it's not a good approach in the first place.

An example is a person asking how to extract the last three characters
of a filename (solution X), because they want to know the file type
(problem Y). After helping them do solution X, it still wouldn't solve
problem Y as some files have extensions of more than three characters.
