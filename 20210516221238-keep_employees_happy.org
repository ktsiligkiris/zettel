#+title: Keep employees happy

The manager is also responsible for keeping her team happy and
productive, and often the solution to this is not cheerleading or
paying them better or praising them more, but instead enabling them to
be more productive, challenging them to go faster and do better work,
and helping them find the time they need to make their work more
interesting.
