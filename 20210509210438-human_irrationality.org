#+title: Human irrationality

The story of the Nobel Prize winner and his investment strategy could
be presented as an example of human irrationality: faced with the
complexity of real life, he abandoned the rational model and followed
a simple heuristic.

But it's precisely because of the complexity of real life that a
simple heuristic might in fact be the rational solution.
